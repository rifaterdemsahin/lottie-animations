## What is Lottie Animation?

Lottie is a powerful animation library developed by Airbnb that renders After Effects animations in real-time. It allows developers to use complex, high-quality animations in web and mobile applications without compromising performance.

### Key Features of Lottie

- **Vector-based**: Scalable animations that look crisp on any screen size
- **Lightweight**: Small file sizes compared to traditional video or GIF formats
- **Interactive**: Animations can be controlled programmatically (play, pause, loop, speed control)
- **Cross-platform**: Works on web (JavaScript), iOS (Swift), Android (Java/Kotlin), and React Native
- **After Effects Integration**: Designers can export animations directly from After Effects using the Bodymovin plugin

### Benefits

1. **Performance**: Smooth 60fps animations with minimal CPU usage
2. **File Size**: JSON format results in smaller files than video or GIF alternatives
3. **Scalability**: Vector-based animations scale perfectly on any device
4. **Customization**: Animations can be modified at runtime (colors, text, etc.)
5. **Accessibility**: Better than image-based animations for screen readers

### Common Use Cases

- Loading indicators and progress bars
- Micro-interactions and UI feedback
- Onboarding illustrations
- Icon animations
- Splash screens
- Interactive storytelling
