I'll create a visual representation of a person evolving their skills from traditional "I" skills to "X" skills (cross-functional/AI-augmented skills) after the AI revolution. However, I should note that the GitHub repository you linked (SAM 3D Objects) is a Meta AI research project for 3D object segmentation, which isn't directly applicable to a web-based visualization in this context.

Instead, I'll create an engaging interactive visualization using Three.js (which we have available) to show this transformation:I've created an interactive 3D visualization showing the transformation from I-shaped skills to X-shaped skills after the AI revolution. Here's what it shows:

**4 Stages of Transformation:**
1. **Before AI Revolution** - Vertical "I" skills (deep in one area)
2. **AI Disruption Begins** - Traditional skills face automation threats
3. **Learning & Adaptation** - Acquiring AI literacy and adjacent skills
4. **After AI Revolution** - "X" shaped skills (multi-domain + AI integration)

Click through the stages to see the skill orbs transform around the figure. The visualization uses Three.js to create an engaging 3D experience.

**Note about the SAM 3D Objects library:** The repository you linked is Meta's research project for 3D segmentation using foundation models, which requires Python, PyTorch, and specialized hardware. It's not directly usable in web-based artifacts. However, I've created this Three.js visualization that captures the conceptual transformation you wanted to show!
